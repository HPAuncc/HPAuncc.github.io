## About Me
I am a Sports Analytics major at UNC Charlotte with a deep-rooted passion for the statistics that drive the games we love. While my technical focus is on optimizing performance and strategy in sports, I am equally driven by a passion for digital privacy. I believe that as we collect more data—on the field and off—we have a growing responsibility to handle that information ethically. My goal this semester is to merge these interests, exploring how high-level analytics can coexist with robust data privacy standards.
